# CarDash

This is my story about why I made this App.
I don’t know why, but I always forget to change the engine oil. 
Usually when you send the car to a mechanic center, they put a sticker on your front window that shows when to come back to change the oil. 

The sticker has information about returning when your car reaches a certain number of miles or a date.

One time, I changed the oil by myself and I forgot to change the sticker, so I didn’t know when my next oil change should take place.

So here I am. According to my car’s owner manual, my engine oil needs to be changed every 10,000 miles or once a year.

So this app is going to have an alert when the car goes over 10,000 miles or a year has passed.
